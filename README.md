# SmartphoneDataCollector
Smartphone's sensor data collector. 
In this app I have included only accelerometer sensor to collect various types of activity data for our research. 
I also save the data into the smartphones memory. For each activity, one have to give the sampling rate of the sensor and it will automatically store data on the smartphone with a unique name (timestamp_samplingrate.csv). Though date was not properly formated in the csv content. Column 3, 4, 5 is the reading of the accelerometer sensor's x, y and z axis.


You can also test this app by installing the mobile-debug.apk in your android smartphone.
